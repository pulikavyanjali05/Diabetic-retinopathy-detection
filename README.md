Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss among diabetic patients worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of DR stages are critical for preventing permanent blindness. This project presents an automated system for Diabetic Retinopathy detection using deep learning techniques integrated with a user-friendly Streamlit interface. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model, based on the EfficientNet architecture, was trained on publicly available retinal fundus image datasets to classify images into five categories: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. The model processes input retinal images and predicts the disease severity level with high accuracy. The web application allows users to upload retinal images and instantly obtain diagnostic predictions along with confidence scores and visual probability distributions. This system aims to support healthcare professionals by providing a fast, reliable, and cost-effective screening tool, enhancing early diagnosis and treatment planning for diabetic patients
